This is a repository of various emulator Lua scripts I've written for different games.

Most of these scripts were written for the mGBA emulator, and also require features that are currently only in development builds of mGBA, such as image overlays and scripted breakpoints. Development builds of mGBA can be downloaded [here](https://mgba.io/downloads.html#development-downloads).
